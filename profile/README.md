# Welcome to the [EdgeSimPy](https://edgesimpy.github.io/) community!


EdgeSimPy is a Python-based Edge Computing simulator with easy-to-grasp abstractions for edge servers, network devices, and applications, and built-in models for user mobility, application composition, and power consumption. An overview of EdgeSimPy use cases is shown in the figure below.

EdgeSimPy was designed to streamline the prototyping of resource management policies through realistic simulations. To do this, EdgeSimPy provides a set of unique functional abstractions (e.g., container registries, images, and layers) that replicate the application provisioning method of widely used platforms such as [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), allowing seamless integration with repositories like [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/).
